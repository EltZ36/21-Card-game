# 21-Card-game
This is the 21 game or Blackjack. This game has been done in python a lot and I want to practice more python with this card game.

Requirements: Requires an IDE that is able to run python 3 and the random library.

Recommendations: Use repl.it to run this or the python IDLE. You can use any IDE however.

Disclaimer: This is not a gambling game and this game shouldn't be used as a way to gamble or bet money. This game is for me to practice lists/arrays instead.
