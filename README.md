# 21-Card-game
This is the 21 or Blackjack. This game has been done in python a lot and I want to practice more python with this card game.
Requirements: Requires an IDE that is able to run python 3 and the random library from python.
Recommendations: Use repl.it to run this or the python IDLE. 
Disclaimer: This is not a gambling game and shouldn't be used as a way to bet. I do not encourage gambling either.
